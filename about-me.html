        <p class="about-me-paragraph-1">
          I've always been obsessed with sharks. My earliest memory is swimming in the bathtub pretending to be a shark. My parents got me all sorts of shark toys
          and merch. When I was six however, I watched the movie Jaws and it scaried me so much that I began to hate sharks. I was scared of taking baths and I even burned 
          one of my sharks toys. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Throughout my teenage year I was still afriad of sharks and didn't like them at all. 
          When I turned 18 I decied to rewatch Jaws and confront my fear. I started doing some research into sharks and I 
          learned that they were not the monsters protrayed in media.  
        </p>
         <p>
           They are dangerous apex predators, but not monsters. I also learned that hundreds of millions of sharks are being killed each year and they're on the verge 
           on extinction. I want to help repair the damage done from the media protrail of sharks by sharing art decipicting the beautiful nature of sharks and donating 
           to ocean conservation efforts.
